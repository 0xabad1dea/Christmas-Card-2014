Abadidea's Christmas Card 2014
==============================

A special blinky-light card for my friends which runs on Nintendo Entertainment System.

* compiles with nesasm (`nesasm christmas2014.asm`)
* music compiles with ppmck (`mknsf sslsmiley`)
* graphics (CHR file) edited with yy-chr or compatible

The NES rom should run in any mainstream emulator as well as hardware. The NSF likewise should play in finer chiptune players everywhere.
